10.48550/arXiv.1902.03383,Cloud Programming Simplified: A Berkeley View on Serverless Computing,"Eric Jonas, Johann Schleier-Smith, Vikram Sreekanti, Chia-Che Tsai, Anurag Khandelwal, Qifan Pu, Vaishaal Shankar, João Carreira, Karl Krauth, Neeraja J. Yadwadkar, Joseph E. Gonzalez, Raluca Ada Popa, Ion Stoica, David A. Patterson",arXiv: Operating Systems,2019,"Serverless cloud computing handles virtually all the system administration operations needed to make it easier for programmers to use the cloud. It provides an interface that greatly simplifies cloud programming, and represents an evolution that parallels the transition from assembly language to high-level programming languages. This paper gives a quick history of cloud computing, including an accounting of the predictions of the 2009 Berkeley View of Cloud Computing paper, explains the motivation for serverless computing, describes applications that stretch the current limits of serverless, and then lists obstacles and research opportunities required for serverless computing to fulfill its full potential. Just as the 2009 paper identified challenges for the cloud and predicted they would be addressed and that cloud use would accelerate, we predict these issues are solvable and that serverless computing will grow to dominate the future of cloud computing.",d086170a-d85a-4e1c-8067-f23359e48327,876,64,,a8db6083-f694-4149-a7ac-197437b3fb02

Hellerstein, Alexey Tumanov",Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2020,"Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) platforms and ""serverless"" cloud computing are becoming increasingly popular. Current FaaS offerings are targeted at stateless functions that do minimal I/O and communication. We argue that the benefits of serverless computing can be extended to a broader range of applications and algorithms. We present the design and implementation of Cloudburst, a stateful FaaS platform that provides familiar Python programming with low-latency mutable state and communication, while maintaining the autoscaling benefits of serverless computing. Cloudburst accomplishes this by leveraging Anna, an autoscaling key-value store, for state sharing and overlay routing combined with mutable caches co-located with function executors for data locality. Performant cache consistency emerges as a key challenge in this architecture. To this end, Cloudburst provides a combination of lattice-encapsulated state and new definitions and protocols for distributed session consistency. Empirical results on benchmarks and diverse applications show that Cloudburst makes stateful functions practical, reducing the state-management overheads of current FaaS platforms by orders of magnitude while also improving the state of the art in serverless consistency.",f5941cd6-1db3-41bc-b33c-b890d4952350,270,111,,"a8db6083-f694-4149-a7ac-197437b3fb02;14b66d98-cbdf-4ba3-9d72-7bcd29221fb5;d086170a-d85a-4e1c-8067-f23359e48327"

This paradigm shifts the complexity of allocating and provisioning resources to the cloud provider, which has to provide the illusion of always-available resources (i.e., fast function invocations without cold starts) at the lowest possible resource cost. Doing so requires the provider to deeply understand the characteristics of the FaaS workload. Unfortunately, there has been little to no public information on these characteristics. Thus, in this paper, we ﬁrst characterize the entire production FaaS workload of Azure Functions. We show for example that most functions are invoked very infrequently, but there is an 8-order-of-magnitude range of invocation frequencies. Using observations from our characterization, we then propose a practical resource management policy that signiﬁcantly reduces the number of function cold starts, while spending fewer resources than state-of-the-practice policies.",9669a1fd-5fcf-4809-b3cd-d2b00e36f6d9,851,44,,"a8db6083-f694-4149-a7ac-197437b3fb02;14b66d98-cbdf-4ba3-9d72-7bcd29221fb5"
10.5555/3388242.3388273,Firecracker: Lightweight Virtualization for Serverless Applications,"Alexandru Agache, Marc Brooker, Andreea Florescu, Alexandra Iordache, Anthony Liguori, Rolf Neugebauer, Phil Piwonka",Symposium on Networked Systems Design and Implementation,2019,"Serverless containers and functions are widely used for deploying and managing software in the cloud. Their popularity is due to reduced cost of operations, improved utilization of hardware, and faster scaling than traditional deployment meth-ods. The economics and scale of serverless applications demand that workloads from multiple customers run on the same hardware with minimal overhead, while preserving strong security and performance isolation. The traditional view is that there is a choice between virtualization with strong security and high overhead, and container technologies with weaker security and minimal overhead. This tradeoff is unacceptable to public infrastructure providers, who need both strong security and minimal overhead. To meet this need, we developed Fire-cracker, a new open source Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM) specialized for serverless workloads, but generally useful for containers, functions and other compute workloads within a reasonable set of constraints. We have deployed Firecracker in two publically-available serverless compute services at Amazon Web Services (Lambda and Fargate), where it supports millions of production workloads, and trillions of requests per month. We describe how specializing for serverless informed the design of Firecracker, and what we learned from seamlessly migrating Lambda customers to Firecracker.",55da9782-ed24-436a-a4d9-7017043c1dea,410,77,,"d086170a-d85a-4e1c-8067-f23359e48327;a8db6083-f694-4149-a7ac-197437b3fb02"
10.5555/3277355.3277444,SAND: Towards High-Performance Serverless Computing,"Istemi Ekin Akkus, Ruichuan Chen, Ivica Rimac, Manuel Stein, Klaus Satzke, Andre Beck, Paarijaat Aditya, Volker Hilt",USENIX Annual Technical Conference,2017,"Serverless computing has emerged as a new cloud computing paradigm, where an application consists of individual functions that can be separately managed and executed. However, existing serverless platforms normally isolate and execute functions in separate containers, and do not exploit the interactions among functions for performance. These practices lead to high startup delays for function executions and inefﬁcient resource usage. This paper presents SAND , a new serverless computing system that provides lower latency, better resource efﬁ-ciency and more elasticity than existing serverless platforms. To achieve these properties, SAND introduces two key techniques: 1) application-level sandboxing, and 2) a hierarchical message bus. We have implemented and deployed a complete SAND system. Our results show that SAND outperforms the state-of-the-art serverless platforms signiﬁcantly. For example, in a commonly-used image processing application, SAND achieves a 43% speedup compared to Apache OpenWhisk.",a8db6083-f694-4149-a7ac-197437b3fb02,533,27,,14b66d98-cbdf-4ba3-9d72-7bcd29221fb5
