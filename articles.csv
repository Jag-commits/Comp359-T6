Thankfully, multifarious advanced approaches have been developed to tackle the prediction issues, such as statistical methods, artificial neural networks (ANNs), and support vector machines. Among them, the interval type-2 fuzzy neural network (IT2FNN), which is a synergistic integration of fuzzy logic systems and ANNs, has received wide attention in the field of chaotic time series prediction. This paper begins with the structural features and superiorities of IT2FNN. Moreover, chaotic characters identification and phase-space reconstruction matters for prediction are presented. In addition, we also offer a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art applications of IT2FNN, with an emphasis on chaotic time series prediction and summarize their main contributions as well as some hardware implementations for computation speedup. Finally, this paper trends and extensions of this field, along with an outlook of future challenges are revealed. The primary objective of this paper is to serve as a tutorial or referee for interested researchers to have an overall picture on the current developments and identify their potential research direction to further investigation.",c370f98c-a9ae-4617-bef0-d48c39943ed6,107,127,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29993733,Han,"Han, 2019",
10.1109/TFUZZ.2019.2914642,Chaotic Type-2 Transient-Fuzzy Deep Neuro-Oscillatory Network (CT2TFDNN) for Worldwide Financial Prediction,Raymond Lee,IEEE transactions on fuzzy systems,2019,"Over the years, financial engineering ranging from the study of financial signals to the modeling of financial prediction is one of the most exciting topics for both academia and financial community. With the flourishing AI technology in the past 20 years, various hybrid intelligent financial prediction systems with the integration of neural networks, chaos theory, fuzzy logic, and genetic algorithms have been proposed. An interval type-2 fuzzy logic system (IT2FLS) with its remarkable capability for the modeling of highly uncertain events and attributes provides a perfect tool to interpret various financial phenomena and patterns. In this paper, the author proposes a chaotic type-2 transient-fuzzy deep neuro-oscillatory network with retrograde signaling (CT2TFDNN) for worldwide financial prediction. With the extension of author's original work on Lee oscillator—a chaotic discrete-time neural oscillator with profound transient-chaotic property—CT2TFDNN provides: effective modeling of an IT2FLS with a chaotic transient-fuzzy membership function; and effective time-series network training and prediction using a chaotic deep neuro-oscillatory network with retrograde signaling. CT2TFDNN not only provides a fast chaotic fuzzy-neuro deep learning and forecast solution, but also successfully resolves the massive data overtraining and deadlock problems, which are usually imposed by traditional recurrent neural networks using classical sigmoid-based activation functions. From the implementation perspective, CT2TFDNN is integrated with 2048 trading-day time-series financial data and top-10 major financial signals as fuzzy financial signals for the real-time prediction of 129 worldwide financial products that consists of: nine major cryptocurrencies, 84 worldwide forex, 19 major commodities, and 17 worldwide financial indices.",eb46d153-51d9-4981-b200-5878765fe981,60,69,(missing PubMedId),Lee,"Lee, 2019",c370f98c-a9ae-4617-bef0-d48c39943ed6
(missing DOI),Sequence to Sequence Learning with Neural Networks,"Ilya Sutskever, Oriol Vinyals, Quoc V. Le",Neural Information Processing Systems,2014,"Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are powerful models that have achieved excellent performance on difficult learning tasks. Although DNNs work well whenever large labeled training sets are available, they cannot be used to map sequences to sequences. In this paper, we present a general end-to-end approach to sequence learning that makes minimal assumptions on the sequence structure. Our method uses a multilayered Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to map the input sequence to a vector of a fixed dimensionality, and then another deep LSTM to decode the target sequence from the vector. Our main result is that on an English to French translation task from the WMT-14 dataset, the translations produced by the LSTM achieve a BLEU score of 34.8 on the entire test set, where the LSTM's BLEU score was penalized on out-of-vocabulary words. Additionally, the LSTM did not have difficulty on long sentences. For comparison, a phrase-based SMT system achieves a BLEU score of 33.3 on the same dataset. When we used the LSTM to rerank the 1000 hypotheses produced by the aforementioned SMT system, its BLEU score increases to 36.5, which is close to the previous state of the art. The LSTM also learned sensible phrase and sentence representations that are sensitive to word order and are relatively invariant to the active and the passive voice. Finally, we found that reversing the order of the words in all source sentences (but not target sentences) improved the LSTM's performance markedly, because doing so introduced many short term dependencies between the source and the target sentence which made the optimization problem easier.",11ee019b-e229-4152-8053-9eb285d5a69a,27162,53,(missing PubMedId),Sutskever,"Sutskever, 2014",ebbbe3e7-4992-4485-9f34-4be80e7ce240

Nóbrega, Adriano L. I. Oliveira",Expert Systems with Applications,2016,"We propose a survey of soft computing techniques applied to financial market.We surveyed several primary studies proposed in the literature.A framework for building an intelligent trading system was proposed.Future directions of this research field are discussed. Financial markets play an important role on the economical and social organization of modern society. In these kinds of markets, information is an invaluable asset. However, with the modernization of the financial transactions and the information systems, the large amount of information available for a trader can make prohibitive the analysis of a financial asset. In the last decades, many researchers have attempted to develop computational intelligent methods and algorithms to support the decision-making in different financial market segments. In the literature, there is a huge number of scientific papers that investigate the use of computational intelligence techniques to solve financial market problems. However, only few studies have focused on review the literature of this topic. Most of the existing review articles have a limited scope, either by focusing on a specific financial market application or by focusing on a family of machine learning algorithms. This paper presents a review of the application of several computational intelligent methods in several financial applications. This paper gives an overview of the most important primary studies published from 2009 to 2015, which cover techniques for preprocessing and clustering of financial data, for forecasting future market movements, for mining financial text information, among others. The main contributions of this paper are: (i) a comprehensive review of the literature of this field, (ii) the definition of a systematic procedure for guiding the task of building an intelligent trading system and (iii) a discussion about the main challenges and open problems in this scientific field.",a1e4d41c-5505-45d0-b89d-f07cfb869dc4,845,177,(missing PubMedId),Cavalcante,"Cavalcante, 2016",1aa622dc-9155-4cc2-a4ba-63892dea4dc0;2cb220ca-19af-4bde-810d-fbc2ae943ced

The rethinking of the basis of financial markets has led to an urgent demand for developing innovative models to understand financial assets. In the past few decades, researchers have proposed several systems based on traditional approaches, such as autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and the exponential smoothing model, in order to devise an accurate data representation. Despite their efficacy, the existing works face some drawbacks due to poor performance when managing a large amount of data with intrinsic complexity, high dimensionality and casual dynamicity. Furthermore, these approaches are not suitable for understanding hidden relationships (dependencies) between data. This paper proposes a review of some of the most significant works providing an exhaustive overview of recent machine learning (ML) techniques in the field of quantitative finance showing that these methods outperform traditional approaches. Finally, the paper also presents comparative studies about the effectiveness of several ML-based systems.",f2d1a3b0-7357-4236-b069-e018fb3c9bff,187,71,(missing PubMedId),Rundo,"Rundo, 2019",11ee019b-e229-4152-8053-9eb285d5a69a;eb46d153-51d9-4981-b200-5878765fe981;a1e4d41c-5505-45d0-b89d-f07cfb869dc4
